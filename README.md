# StockWatcher
Used in Amz B4U servers to snipe their stock. &lt;3


## How to use StockWatcher
Fork StockWatcher or download/copy the `stockv2.py` file to your computer.
Download [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-386/) - remember to follow the steps, since you __need__ to add to PATH.
Right click in the folder where you have `stockv2.py` and make a file named `token.json` with the following format `{"token": "INSERT TOKEN HERE"}` where you replace the text with your Discord token.
In your folder, open command prompt by clicking the bar, write `cmd` and click enter.
When in the opened command prompt window, write `py stockv2.py` or alternatively `python stockv2.py`


## How to get your Discord Token
Go to [Discord](https://www.discord.com/) and click CTRL+I and login or click the first https://discord.com/api/v8/science request you can find.
Look under headers and you should be able to find an Authorization header - just get the value of it.
That's it!
